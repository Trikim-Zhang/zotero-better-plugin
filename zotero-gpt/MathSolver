Read these content:

```js
const ztoolkit = Zotero.ZoteroGPT.data.ztoolkit
let getSelection = () => {
    return ztoolkit.Reader.getSelectedText(
 Zotero.Reader.getByTabID(Zotero_Tabs.selectedID)
    );
}
console.log(getSelection())
getSelection()
```

From now on, if you need to write a mathematical expression, use latex notation and follow these rules:
1. If it is a block equation, display it in a single P element and wrap it with double dollar signs like this:
$$e=mc^{2}$$

2. If it is an inline equation, wrap it with a double dollar sign, like this: $e=mc^{2}$

You should first explain the proof or equations step by step and demonstrations of various techniques to better understand or apply these concepts/equations.
